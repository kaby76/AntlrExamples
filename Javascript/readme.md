# Javascript in Antlr using Trgen drivers

This directory contains a copy of the [JavaScript](https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/tree/master/javascript/javascript) grammar
in [grammars-v4](https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4) that has been set up with
[trgen](https://github.com/kaby76/Domemtech.Trash/tree/main/trgen) drivers. This tool is
part of the [Trash toolkit](https://github.com/kaby76/Domemtech.Trash) for grammars.
The end result of running the tool is a complete, self-contained program whereby you and
just type "make" (or "dotnet build" in the case of the C# program) to build the program.
For C#, you need to have dotnet installed. for the other targets, you will need the
Antlr4 tool JAR file and any additional dependencies for your programming environment.
