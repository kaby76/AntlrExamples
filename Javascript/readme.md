# Javascript in Antlr using Trgen drivers

This directory contains a copy of the [JavaScript](https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/tree/master/javascript/javascript) grammar
in [grammars-v4](https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4) that has been set up with
[trgen](https://github.com/kaby76/Domemtech.Trash/tree/main/trgen) drivers. Trgen is
part of the [Trash toolkit](https://github.com/kaby76/Domemtech.Trash) for grammars.

The code contained here can be built using "make" or "dotnet build".
You will need to set yourself up with the appropriate environment for the build,
i.e., download and install dotnet for building and running C#, download the
Antlr4 tool JAR file and installing Java or Node.js for the other targets.

For any other targets not contained here, use trgen to generate the driver.
